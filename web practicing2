  <p>
    <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
    that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[11] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is high-level,
    often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing,
    prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.
    Alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    [12] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
    [13] often incorporating third-party libraries.
    [14] All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on the user's device.
    As a multi-paradigm language, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> supports event-driven, functional,
    and imperative programming styles.
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
    standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O),
    such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
    In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides <span class="js">JavaScript</span> APIs for I/O.
